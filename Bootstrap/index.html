</div>

                <!--browsers and devices chapter starts now-->

<div><h1 class="text-center">browsers and devices & layout (breakpoints, containers)</h1>
<p> Learn about the browsers and devices, from modern to old, that are supported by Bootstrap, including
     known quicks and bugs for each.</p>
<h3>supported browsers:</h3>
<p> Bootstrap supports the latest stable releases for all major browsers and platforms.<Br>
alternative browsers that use the latest version of WebKit, blank, or Gecko, whether directly or via 
the platform's web view API is not explicitly
supported, however, bootstrap should (in most cases) display and function
correctly in these browsers as well.<br>
we use autoprefixer to handle intended browser support via CSS prefixes. which uses browser lists to 
manage these browser versions. consult their documentation for how to integrate these tools into your 
projects,</p>
<h2>mobile devices</h2>
<p> Generally speaking, bootstrap supports the latest versions of each major platform's default browsers.
<span class="span1"> note:</span> that proxy browsers (such as opera mini,
opera mobile's turbo mode, uc browser mini, and Amazon Silk) are not supported.</p>
<h2>desktop browsers</h2>
<P> Similarly, the latest versions of most desktop browsers are supported:</P>
<table ><tr class="table heading"><th></th><th>chrome</th><th>firefox</th><th>microsoft edge</th>
    <th>opera</th><th>safari</th></tr>
<tr><th>mac</th><td>supported</td><td>supported</td><td>supported</td>
    <td>supported</td><td>supported</td></tr>
<tr><th>windows</th><td>supported</td><td>supported</td><td>supported</td>
    <td>supported</td><td>not supported </td></tr>
</table>
<p>unoffically, bootstrap should look and behave well enough in Chromium and Chrome for Linux, and Firefox
   for Linux, though they are not officially supported.</p>

        <!--breakpoints chapter start now-->

   <h1 class="text-center"> what are breakpoints ?</h1>
<p>breakpoints are <span class="span1">customizable widths</span> that determine how your 
  <span class="span1">responsive layout</span> behaves <span class="underline1">across devices or 
    viewport sizes</span>
in bootstrap.</p>
<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<ul><li>breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design. use them to control when your layout 
  can be adapted at a particular <span class="span1">viewport or device size</span> </li>
<li>use <span class="span1">media queries</span> to architect your CSS by breakpoint. media queries
   are a <span class="span1">feature of CSS</span> that allows you to conditionally apply styles based
    on a set of 
<span class="span1">min-width </span>in our media queries.</li>
<li> Mobile-first responsive design is the goal.<span class="span1"> Bootstrap's CSS</span> aims to
   apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint. and then layers
    on styles to
<span class="span1">adjust that design for larger devices.</span> this optimizes your CSS, improves
 <span class="span1">rendring time,</span> and provides a <span class="span1">Great experience for 
  your visitors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>available breakpoints</h2>
<p>bootstrap includes <span class="span1">six default breakpoints.</span> sometimes referred to as
   <span class="span1">grid tiers</span>. for building responsively. these breakpoints can be customized
    if you're using our
   source Sass files.<br><br>
Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 
<span class="span1">12</span>. breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes
 and viewport dimensions--they don't specifically target every use case or device. instead. the ranges
  provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.</p>

  <h1>media queries</h1>
<p>media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.<br>
it uses the media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.<br>
if the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be light blue.<br>
media only screen and (max-widht:600px)<br>body{background-color:light blue;} </p>

<h1>add a breakpoint</h1>
<p> Media queries can help with that. we can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design 
  will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.<br><br>
use a media query to add a breakpoint at 768px:<br>
when the screen browser window gets smaller than 768px each column should have width of 100%</p>
</div>

                         <!--layout-containers chapter starts now-->
<div>
<h1 class="text-center">--layout-containers--</h1>
<h2>what are containers</h2>
<p>containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain,<span class="span1">pad,</span>
and <span class="span1">align your content</span> <span class="underline1">within a given device or
   viewport.</span> </p>
<h2>how they work?</h2>
<p>containers are most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are<span class="span1"> required when using
   our default grid system.</span>containers are used to contain. pad and (sometimes) center the content
    with them, where containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>
<ul></span> <span class="underline1">bootsrap comes with three different containers:</span><br>
<li><span class="orange">container,</span>which sets a <span class="orange">max-width</span>
at each responsivebreakpoint</li>
<li><span class="orange">container-{breakpoint},</span> which is <span class="orange">widht:100%</span>
until the specified breakpoint</li>
<li><span class="orange">container-fluid.</span> which is <span class="orange">width:100%</span> at all
   breakpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>the table below illustrates how each container's <span class="orange">max-widht</span> compares to the
   original.
<spn class="orange">container-fluid across each breakpoint,</spn></p> 

<h2>default container</h2>
<p>our default <span class="orange">container </span> class is a responsive, fixed-width container meaning
 its <span class="orange">max-width</span>changes at each breakpoint.<br>
&lt;div class="container"&gt; <br>
&lt;!--content here --&gt; <br>
&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<h2>fluid containers</h2>
<ul><li>use <span class="orange">.container-fluid</span> for a full width container, spanning the entire 
  width of the viewport.<br>
&lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;<br>
...<br>
&lt;/div&gt;</li>
<h2>responsive containers</h2>
<li> Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wid until the specified
  a breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints, for example
   <span class="orange">
    container-sm</span> is 100% wide to start until the <span class="orange">sm</span> breakpoint is
     reached, where it
     will scale up with<span class="orange"> md ,lg,xl</span> and<span> xxl</span><br><br>
     &lt;div class="container-sm"&gt; 100% wide until small breakpoint&lt;/div&gt;<br>
     &lt;div class="container-md"&gt; 100% wide until medium breakpoint&lt;/div&gt;<br>
     &lt;div class="container-ig"&gt; 100% wide until large breakpoint&lt;/div&gt;<br>
     &lt;div class="container-xl"&gt; 100% wide until extra large breakpoint&lt;/div&gt;<br>
     &lt;div class="container-xxl"&gt; 100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint&lt;/div&gt;<br>
    </li>
  </ul></div>

                      <!--grid system chapter starts now-->

  <div><h1 class="text-center">Layout (grid system) </h1>
  <h2>what are grid system?</h2>
  <p> Use a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build the layout of all shapes and sizes
      thanks to a twelve-column system, six default responsive tiers, sass variables and mixins, and dozens of
     predefined classes</p>
    <h2>how it works?</h2>
  <ul><li>supports<span class="span1"> six responsive breakpoints</span>. breakpoints are based on
    <span class="orange"> min-width</span> media queries. meaning they affect that breakpoint and all
     those above it (e.g.<span class="orange">col-sm-4</span> applies to <span class="orange">sm.
   Md. lg.xl</span> and <span class="orange">xxl</span>) This means you can control container and column 
  sizing and behavior by each breakpoint.</li>
<li><span class="span1">containers center and horizontally pad your content:</span> use
   <span class="orange"> container</span> for a responsive pixel width, <span class="orange">container-fluid    
   </span> for <span class="orange">width:100%</span> across all viewports and devices, or a responsive
  container (e.g <span class="orange">container-md</span>) for a combination of fluid and pixel widths.</li>
  <li><span class="span1">rows are wrappers for columns:</span> each column has horizontal
  <span class="orange">padding</span>(<span class="span1">called a gutter</span>) for controlling the space 
between them. this <span class="orange">padding</span> is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins
 to ensure the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. row also supports modifier
  classes to <span class="underline1">uniformly apply column sizing</span> and <span class="underline1">
    gutter classes</span> to change the spacing of your content.</li>
<h2>example</h2>
<li>bootsrap's grid system uses a series of containers rows, and columns to layout and align content,
   it should with Flexbox and is fully responsive, below is an example and in-depth explanation of how the
    grid system comes to gather.</li>

example is commented in the HTML file here
</ul>
<p> the example creates three equal-width columns across all devices and viewports using our predefined grid
   classes. those columns are centered on the page with the parent. <span class="orange">container</span>.
</p></div>

<!--<div class="container text-center">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
          column
      </div>
      <div class="col">
          column
      </div>
      <div class="col">
          column
      </div>
  </div>
      </div>-->
<div>
<h2>how it works?</h2>
<ul><li><span class="span1">columns are incredibly flexible.</span> these are <span class="span1">12</span>
template columns available per row. allowing you to create different combinations of elements that span any 
number of columns, column classes indicate the number of template columns to span (e.g,<span class="orange">
  col-4</span>spans four).<span class="orange">widhts</span> is set in percentages so you always have the 
  same relative sizing.</li>
<li><span class="span1">gutters are also responsive and customizable</span> gutter classes are available
   across all breakpoints. with all the same sizes as our margin and padding spacing. change horizontal
    gutters with <span class="orange">.gx.</span> classes. vertical gutters with <span class="orange">.gy.
    </span> or all gutters with <span class="orange">.g.</span> classes. <span class="orange">.g-0</span>
     is also available to remove gutters.</li>
     <li><span class="span1">Sass variables, maps, and mixins power the grid</span> If you don't want to
    use the predefined grid classes in Bootstrap, you can use our grid, 's source Sass to create your own
  with more semantic markup. we also include some CSS custom properties to consume these Sass variables 
for even greater flexibility for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>auto-layout columns</h2>
<p>uitlize breakpoint-specific column classes for easy column sizing without an explicit numbered class 
  like <span class="orange">col-sm-6</span>. </p>
  <ul><li>eqaul-width</li>
  <li>setting one column width</li>
<li>variable width content</li></ul>
<h2> equal-width</h2>
<p> For example, here are two grid layouts that apply to every device and viewport. from <span class="orange">
  xs</span> and <span class="orange">xxl</span>. add any number of unit classes for each breakpoint  you
need and every column will be the same width.</p>
<h2>setting one column width</h2>
<p> Auto-layout for flexbox grid columns also means you can set the width of one column and have the 
  sibling columns automatically resize around it. you may use predefined grid classes (as shown below).
  grid mixins. or inline widths note that the other columns will resize no matter the width of the 
  center column.
</p>
<h2>variable width content</h2>
<p>use <span class="orange">col-{breakpoint}-auto</span> classes to size columns based on the natural width
of their content.</p>
<h2>responsive classes</h2>
<p> Bootstrap's grid includes six tiers of predefined classes for building complex responsive layouts.
  customize the size of your columns on <span class="span1">extra small, small, medium, large,</span>
  or <span class="span1">extra large</span> devices however you see fit.</p>
<ul><li>all breakpoints</li>
<li>stacked  to horizontal</li>
<li>mix and match</li>
<li>row columns</li></ul>
<h2>all breakpoints</h2>
<p> For grids that are the same from the smallest of devices to the largest, use the <span class="orange">
  .col</span> and <span class="orange"> .col-*</span> classes. specify a numbered class when you
need a particularly sized column; otherwise. feel free to stick to <span class="orange">
  .col.</span></p>
<h2>stacked to horizontal</h2>
<p>using a single set of <spna class="orange">.col-sm-*</spna> classes. you can create a basic grid system
that starts out stacked and becomes horizontal at the small breakpoint (<span class="orange">sm</span>)</p>
<h2>mix and match</h2>
<p> Don't want your columns to simply stack in some grid tiers? use a combination of different classes for each
   tier as needed. see the example below for a better idea of how it all works.</p>
<h2>row columns</h2>
<p> Use the responsive <span class="orange">.row-col-*</span> classes to quickly set the number of columns
that best render your content and layout. whereas normal <span class="orange">.col-*</span> classes apply
 to the individual columns (e.g.. <span class="orange">.col-md-4</span>). the row columns classes are set
  on the 
parent. row as a shortcut. width <span class="orange">.row-cols-auto</span> you can give the columns their
 natural width. use these row-column classes to quickly create a basic grid layout or to control your card
  layouts. </p>
<h2>nesting</h2>
<p>to nest your content with the default gird. add a new <span class="orange">.row</span> and set fo 
  <span class="orange">.col-sm-*</span> columns within an existing <span class="orange">.col-sm-*</span> 
  column nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12 or fewer (ut us bit required that 
  you use all 12 available columns). </p>
</div>

             <!--grid system (columns)-->
<div>
             <h1 class="text-center">grid system (columns)</h1>
<p> Learn how to modify columns with a handful of options for alignment. ordering, and offsetting thanks to
   our flexbox grid system plus, see how to use column classes to manage widths of non-grid elements.</p>
  <h3>alignment</h3>
  <p> Use flexbox alignment utilities to vertically and horizontally align columns</p>
<h3>vertical alignment</h3>
<p> Change the vertical alignment with any of the responsive align-items classes.</p>
<h3>horizontal alignment</h3>
<p> Change the horizontal alignment with any of the responsive justify-content-* classes
</p>
<h2>column wrapping</h2>
<p> If more than <span class="span1">12</span> columns are placed within a single row each group of extra
   coumns will as one unit. wrap onto a new line.</p>
<h2>column breaks</h2>
<p> Breaking columns to a new line in Flexbox requires a small hack: add an element with width:
  100% wherever you want to wrap your columns to a new line. normally this is accomplished with multiple
  rows but not every implementation method can account for this.
</p>
<h2 class="text-center">reordering</h2>
<h3>order classes:</h3>
<p> Use order classes for controlling the visual order of your content. these classes are responsive. so you
   can set the order by breakpoint (e.g.. order-1 order.md-2) includes support for 1 through 5 across all
    six grid tiers. if you need more order.<br> there are also responsive .order-first and ,order-last 
    classes that change the order of an element by applying order:-1 and order:6
respectively. these classes can also be intermixed with the order of the numbers-* classes as needed.</p>
<h2>offsetting columns</h2>
<p> You can offset grid columns in two ways: our responsive <span class="orange">.offset- grid</span> 
  classes and our <span class="orange">margin utilities</span> . gird classes are sized to match courses
   while margins are more useful for quick layouts where the width 
of the offset is variable.</p>
<h2>offset classes</h2>
<p>move coumns to the right using <span class="orange">offset-md-*</span> classes. these classes increase 
  the left margin of a column by
<span class="orange">*</span> columns. for example. <span class="orange">offset-md-4</span> moves.
<span class="orange"> col-md-4</span> over four columns.</p>

   alt="browser not supported">

  <p>
    A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use of the clearfix class. We're adding
     quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look
     with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on,
      but actually conveys no tangible information. It simply takes up space and should not be read.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights,
     or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.

 <div>
                           <h1 class="text-center"> gutters</h1>
 
<p> Gutters are the padding between your columns, used to responsively space and align content in the
     bootstrap grid system.</p>
<h3>how they work</h3>
<ul><li>gutters are the gaps between columns content. created by horizontal padding. we set padding-right 
  and padding left on each column. and use a negative margin to offset that at the start and end of each
  row to align content.
</li>
<li>gutters start at<span class="span1">1.5rem</span> (24px) wide</li>
<li> Gutters can be responsively adjusted. use breakpoint-specific gutter classes to modify horizontal 
  gutters. vertical gutters, and all gutters.</li></ul>
  <h2>horizontal gutters</h2>
  <p><span class="orange">.gx-*</span> classes can be used to control the horizontal gutter widths. the
  container or container-fluid parent may need to be adjusted if larger gutters are used too to avoid 
unwanted overflow. using a matching padding utility. for example, in the following
example, we've increased the padding with<span class="orange">,px-4</span></p>

 <div>
                         <h1 class="text-center">utilities and z-index</h1>

<h2>utilities for layout</h2>
<p>for faster mobile-friendly and responsive development. bootstrap includes dozens of utility classes
  for snowing. hiding, aligning, and spacing content.
</p>
<h3>changing display:</h3>
<p> Use our display utilities for responsively toggling common values of the display property, and mix it with 
  our grid system. content. or components to show or hide them across specific viewports.
</p>
<h3>flexbox options</h3>
<p> Bootstrap is built with Flexbox, but not every element's display has been changed to display: flex as 
  this would add many unnecessary overrides and unexpectedly change key browser behaviors.
</p>
<h3>margin and padding</h3>
<p> Use the margin and padding spacing utilities to control how elements and components are spaced and sized. 
  bootstrap includes a six-level scale for spacing utilities. based on a 1rem value default  $spacer variable.
   choose values for all viewports<span class="orange"> (e.g.. me-3 for margin-right:1rem in LTR)</span>. or 
   pick responsive variants to target spacific viewwports <span class="orange">(e.g.. me-md-3 for margin-right.
     1rem --in LTR--) starting at the md breakpoint </span>,
</p>
<h2>z-index</h2>
 
<p>while not a part of Bootstrap's grid system. z-indexes play an important part in how our components overlay
  and interact with one another.<br>
  several bootstrap components utilities z-index, the CSS property that helps control layout by providing a 
  third axis to arrange content. we utilize a default z-index scale in Bootstrap that's been designed to
   properly layer navigation, tooltips, and popovers. models. and more.<br>
   <img class="rounded col-md-6 col-lg-5 float-md-end mb-3 ms-2" src="./assests/Capture.JPG"
   alt="browser not supported"/>
   these higher values start at an arbitrary number. high and specific enough to ideally avoid conflicts.
    we need a standard set of these across our layered components--tooltips, and popovers. navbars, dropdowns,
     modals--so we can be reasonably consistent in the behaviors, there's no reason we couldn't have used 
     100+ or 500+.<br> We don't encourage customization of these individual values; should you change one? 
     you likely need to change them all.
  
  to handle overlapping borders within components (e.g.. buttons and inputs in input groups), we use low
   single-digit z-index values of 1,2 and 3 for default, hover, and active states, one hover/focus/active,
    we bring a particular element to the forefront with a higher z-index value to show their border over
    the sibling elements.

  <p> Bootstrap sets basic global display, typography, and link styles, when more control is needed, 
    check out the <span class="underline1">textaul utility classes</span>.
  </p>
  <ul><li>use a <span class="underline1">native font stack</span> that select the best <span class="orange">

  <li>for a more inclusive and accessible type scale. we use the browser's default root <span class="orange">
    font-size</span> (typically 16px) so visitors can customize their browser defaults as needed.</li>
  <li>use the <span class="orange">sfont-family-base. Sfont-size-base</span> and <span class="orange">
    Sline-height-base</span> attributes as our typographic base applied to the <span class="orange">

   <p>these styles can be found within <span class="orange">-reboot.scss,</span>and the global variables are
     defined in <span class="orange">-variable.scss.</span> make sure to set <span class="orange">
      Sfont-size-base</span> in <span class="orange">rem.</span></p>
    <h2>inline text elements</h2>
    <p>styling for common inline HTML5 elements. beware that those tags should be used for semantic purposes:</p>
    <ul><li><span class="orange">&lt;mark&gt;</span> represents text that is marked or highlighted for
       reference or notation purposes.</li>
  <li><span class="orange">&lt;small&gt;</span> represents side-comments and small print like copyright and
     legal text.</li>
    <li><span class="orange">&lt;s&gt;</span> represents elements that are no longer relevant or no longer
       accurate.</li>
  <li><span class="orange">&lg;u&gt;</span>represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a
     way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.</li></ul>
  <p> If you want to style your text, you should use the following classes instead:</p>
  <ul><li><spane class="orange">.mark</spane> will apply the same styles as <span class="orange"> &lt;mark&gt;
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="orange">.small</span>will apply the same styles as <span class="orange">&lt;small&gt;
</span></li>
<li><span class="orange">.text-decoration-underline</span> will apply the same styles as <span class="orange">

   <h2>abbreviations</h2>
   <p>Stylized implementation of HTML's &lt;abbr&gt; element for abbreviations and acronyms to show the 
    expanded version on hover. Abbreviations have a default underline and gain a help cursor to provide
     additional context on hover and to users of assistive technologies.</p>
     <h2>Naming a source</h2>
<p>The HTML spec requires that blockquote attribution be placed outside the &lt;blockquote&gt;. When providing
   attribution, wrap your &lt;blockquote&gt; in a &lg;figure&gt; and use a &lt;figcaption&gt; or a block level
    element (e.g., &lt;p&gt;) with the .blockquote-footer class. Be sure to wrap the name of the source work

<div>
  <h1 class="text-center">forms</h1>
<h2>form controls</h2>
  <p>
    give textual form controls like &lt;input&gt;s and &lt;textarea&gt;s an upgrade with custom styles,
    sizing, focus, states, and more.<br>
    form controls are styled with a mix of Sass and CSS variables, allowing them to adapt to color modes
    and support any customization method.
  </p>
  
  <h2>sizing</h2>
  <p>set heights using classes like form-control-lg and form-control-sm</p>

  <h2>form text</h2>
  <p> Block level or inline-level form text can be created using form-text form text below inputs can be styled
    with form-text. if a block-level element will be used a top margin is added for easy spacing from the 
    input above.<br> 
    inline text can use any typical inline HTML element (be it a &lt;span&gt; or &lg;small&gt; or something else)
    with nothing more than the form-text class.
  </p>
  <h2>disabled</h2>
  <p> Add the disabled boolean attribute on an input to give it a grayed-out appearance. remove pointer events, 
    and prevent focusing.</p>
<h2>file input</h2>
<p>choose file no file chosen multiple files input example choose files no file chosen disabled file input example 
  choose file no file chosen small file input example.
</p>
<h2>color</h2>
<p>set the type="color" and add form-control-color to the &lg;input&gt; we use the modifier class to set fixed heights
  and heights and override some inconsistencies between browsers.
</p>
<h2>select</h2>
<p> Customize the native &lt;select&gt; with custom CSS that changes the element's initial appearance.</p>
<h3>default</h3>
<p>custom &lg;select&gt; menus need only a custom class. form-select to trigger the custom styles, custom styles are 
  limited to the &lt;select&gt;'s initial appearance and cannot modify the &lt;option&gt; due to browser limitations.
</p>
<h2>sizing selects</h2>
<p> You may also choose from small and large custom selects to match our similarly sized text inputs.</p>
<h2>accessiblity</h2>
<p>Ensure that all form controls have an appropriate accessible name so that their purpose can be conveyed
   to users
   of assistive technologies. 
  The simplest way to achieve this is to use a &lt;label&gt; element, or—in the case of buttons—to include 
    sufficiently descriptive text as part of the &lt;button&gt;...&lt;/button&gt; content.

  For situations where it’s not possible to include a visible &lt;label&gt; or appropriate text content, there are
     alternative ways of still providing an accessible name, such as:
  
  &lt;label&gt; elements hidden using the .visually-hidden class
  Pointing to an existing element that can act as a label using aria-labelled by
  Providing a title attribute
  Explicitly setting the accessible name on an element using aria-label
  If none of these are present, assistive technologies may resort to using the placeholder attribute as a 
  fallback for the accessible name on &lt;input&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt; elements. The examples in this section provide
     a few suggested, case-specific approaches.
  
  While using visually hidden content (.visually-hidden, aria-label, and even placeholder content,
   which disappears once a form field has content) will benefit assistive technology users, a lack of 
   visible label text may still be problematic for certain users. Some form of visible label is generally 
   the best approach, both for accessibility and usability.</p>

   <h2 class="text-center">checks and radios</h2>
<h3>approach</h3>
<p> Browser default checkboxes and radios are replaced with the help of <span class="span1">.form-check.</span> A series 
of classes for both input types that improve the layout and behavior of their HTML elements. provide greater
 customization and cross-browser consistency. checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list. while radios
  are for selecting one option from many.<br>
structurally, our <span class="span1">&lt;input&gt;</span> and <span class="span1">&lt;label&gt;</span> are siling elements
 as opposed to an <span class="span1">&lt;input&gt;</span> within a <span class="span1">&lt;label&gt;</span> this is
  slightly more verbose as you must specify id and for  attributes to relate the <span class="span1">&lt;input&gt;</span>
and <span class="span1">&lt;label&gt;</span> we use the sibling selector ('') for all our <span class="span1">&lt;input&gt;
  </span> states. like <span class="span1">checked</span> or <span class="span1"> disabled.</span>.when combined with the 
.form-check-label class. we can easily style the text for each of them based on the &lt;input&gt;'s states.</p>
<h3>default stacked</h3>
<p> By default, any number of checkboxes and radios that are immediate siblings will be vertically stacked and appropriately
   spaced with .form-check</p>
<h3>inline</h3>
<p> Group checkboxes or radios on the same horizontal row by adding <span class="orange">.form-check-inline</span> to any 
form-check.</p>
<h3>reverse</h3>
<p>put your checkboxes. radios, and switches on the opposite side with the <span class="orange">.form-check-reverse</span>
modifier class</p>
<h3>without labels</h3>
<p>omit the wrapping form-check for checkboxes and radios that have no label text. remember to still provide some form of 
  accessible name for assistive technologies (for instance, using an aria-label).
</p>
<h3>toggle buttons</h3>
<p>create button-like checkboxes and radio buttons by using <span class="orange">.btn</span> styles rather than <span
   class="orange">.form-check-label</span> on the &lt;lable&gt; elements. these toggle buttons can further be grouped in a 
  button group if needed.</p>
  <h3>range</h3>
<p>create custom <span class="orange">&lt;input type range&gt;</span> controls with <span class="orange">.form-range.</span>
the track (the background) and thumb (the value) are both sized to appear the same across browsers. </p>
<H3>range disabled</H3>
<p> Add the disabled boolean attribute on an input to give it a grayed-out appearance. remove pointer events and
   prevent focusing</p>
   <h3>max and min</h3>
   <p>range inputs have implicit values for min and max-- 0 and 100. respectively.<br>
  you may specify new values for those using the min and max attributes.</p>
  <h3>range steps </h3>
  <p> By default, range inputs "snap" to integer values. to change this. you can specify a step value.<br>
  in the example in the file linked forms, we double the number of steps by using step="0.5". </p>
<h3>input groups</h3>
<p>easily extend form controls by adding text. buttons, or button groups on either side of textual inputs, custom 
selects, and custom file inputs </p>
<h4>example</h4>
<p> Place one add-on or button on either side of an input. you may also place one on both sides of an input. remember to place
  <span class="orange">&lt;label&gt;</span>s outside the input group. </p>
<h2>floating labels</h2>
<p> Simple form labels that float over your input fields. wrap a pair of <span class="orange">&lt;input class="form-
  control"&gt;</span> and <span class="orange">&lt;label&gt;</span> elements in <span class="orange">form-floating</span> to 
enable floating labels with bootstrap's textual form fields. <span class="span1">A placeholder</span> is required on each
<span class="orange">&lt;input&gt;</span> as our method of CSS-only floating labels uses the <span class="orange">placeholder
  -shown</span> pseudo-element</p>
  <h3>textareas</h3>
  <p>by default, <span class="orange">&lt;textarea&gt;</span> with form-control will be the same height as
 <span class="orange">&lt;input&gt;</span>s. </p>
 <h3>selects</h3>
 <p>other than <span class="orange">form-control</span> floating labels are only available on. <span 
  class="orange">form-selects.</span> they work in the same way. but unlike <span class="orange">&lt;input&gt;
</span>s. they'll always show the <span class="orange">&lt;label&gt;</span> i its floated state. selects with 
size and multiple are not supported.</p>
<h3>disabled</h3>
<p>add the disabled boolean attribute on an input. a text or a selection to give it a grayed-out appearance.
  remove pointer events. and prevent focusing.
</p>
<h3>readonly plaintext</h3>
<p>floating labels also support <span class="orange">form-control-plaintext</span> which can be helpful for toggling
form an editable <span class="orange">&lt;input&gt;</span> to a plaintext value without affecting the page layout.</p>
<h3>layout</h3>
<p>when working with the bootstrap grid system, be sure to place form elements within column classes. give your forms some
  structure --from inline to horizontal to custom grid implementations--- with our form layout options.
</p>
<h3>forms</h3>
<p>every group of form fields should reside in a <span class="orange">&lt;form&gt;</span> element. bootstrap provides
no default styling for the <span class="orange">&lt;form&gt;</span> element.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>utilities</h3>
<p><span class="span1">margin utilities</span> are the easiest way to add some structure to forms. they provide a basic 
grouping of labels. controls, optional form text, and form validation presaging.<br>
we recommend sticking to <span class="orange">margin-bottom-utilities</span> and using a single direction throughout the
 form for consistency.<br>
feel free to build your forms. however you like, with <span class="orange">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>s. <span class="orange">
  &lt;div&gt;</span>s. or nearly any other element.</p>
  <h3>form grid</h3>
  <p> More complex forms can be built using our grid classes. use these for form layouts. that require multiple columns, varied
    widths, and additional alignment options.
  </p>
  <h2>horizontal form</h2>
  <p> Create horizontal forms with the grid by adding the <span class="orange">.row</span> class to form groups and using the 
  <span class="orange">.col-*-*</span> classes to specify the width of your labels and controls. be sure to add <span 
  class="orange">col-form-label</span> to your &lt;label&gt; as well so they're vertically centered with their associated form 
  controls<br>
at times, you maybe need to use margin or padding utilities to create that perfect alignment you need. we removed the padding-top 
on our stacked radio inputs label to better align the text baseline.</p>
<ul><li><h3>horizontal form label sizing</h3>
<p>be sure to use <span class="orange">.col-form-label-sm</span> or <span class="orange">.col-form-label-lg</span> to your &lt;label&gt;s 
or &lt;legend&gt;s to correctly follow the size of form-control-lg and form-control-sm</p></li></ul>
<h2>coumn sizing</h2>
<p>as shown in the previous examples. our grid system allows you to place any number of <span class="orange">.cols</span> within a 
<span class="orange">.row</span><br>
they'll split the available width equally between them. you may also pick a subset of your columns to take up more or less space. while 
the remaining .cols equally split the rest. with specific column classes like .col-sm-7</p>
<h3>auto-sizing</h3>
<p> The example below uses a flexbox utility to vertically center the contents and changes <span class="orange">.col</span> to <span 
  class="orange">.col-auto</span> so that your columns only take up as much space as needed.<br>
put another way, the column sizes itself based on the contents.</p>
<h2>inline forms</h2>
<p>use the <span class="orange">.row-cols-*</span> classes to create responsive horizontal layouts. 
by adding gutter modifier classes, we'll have gutters in horizontal and vertical directions, on narrow mobile viewports. the .col-12 
  helps stack the form controls and more. the align-items-center aligns the form elements to the middle. making the .form-check 
  align property</p>
<h1 class="text-center">validation</h1>
<p> Provide valuable, actionable, feedback to your users with HTML5 form validation, via browser default 
  behaviors or custom styles and 
  JavaScript.</p></div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="text-center">components</h1>
    <h2 class="text-center">(accordion, alerts, badges and breadcrumbs ) </h2>
  <p> A bootstrap accordion is a web UI element that allows you to create collapsible content sections, users 
    can click on a panel's heading
    to expand or collapse its content, it is a handy way to display information company on a web page.
</p>
<h2>how it works</h2>
<p> The accordion uses collapse internally to make it collapsible. to render an accordion that's expanded. 
  add the <code>.open</code> class
   on the <code>accordion</code> </p>
   <h2>flush</h2>
   <p>add <code>.accordion-flush</code> to remove some borders and rounded corners to render accordions 
    edge-to-edge with their parent 
    containers</p>
<h2>always open</h2>
<p>omit the data-bs-parent attribute on each .accordion-collapse to make accordion items stay open when 
  another item is opened</p>
  <h2>alerts</h2>
  <p> Bootstrap alerts are brief message components in the Bootstrap framework for displaying information,
     warnings, or success messages on webpages, which come in various styles and are used for feedback and
      notifications</p>
      <h3>example</h3>
      <p> Alerts are available for any length of text as well as an optional close button, for proper styling 
        use one of the eight required contextual classes (e.g. alert-success).
      </p>
      <h3>link color</h3>
      <p>use the <code>.alert-link</code> utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within 
        any alert</p>
        <h2>additional content</h2>
        <p> Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and dividers.
          <div class="alert alert-success mx-5" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>
            <p>Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going
               to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of
                content.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="MB-0">Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and 
              tidy.</p>
          </div>
        </p>
<h2>icons</h2>
<p> Similarly, you can use Flexbox utilities and bootstrap icons to create alerts with icons, depending on
   your icons and content you may want to add more utilities or custom styles. </p>
   <h2>badges</h2>
   <p> Bootstrap badges are small, round labels that show numbers or status updates, like notifications, in 
    a simple way on a webpage.
   </p>
   <h3>buttons</h3>
   <p> Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.</p>
   <h3>positioned</h3>
   <p> Use utilities to modify a badge and position it in the corner of a link or button.</p>
   <h3>background colors</h3>
   <p> These are customizable colors applied to bootstrap badges to make them visually distinct and emphasize 
    their purpose, like highlighting important information or showing status.
   </p>
   <h3>pill badges</h3>
   <p> Use the rounded-pill utility class to make badges more rounded with a larger border-radius.</p>
  <h3>breadcrumb</h3>
  <p>indicate the current page's location within a navigational hierarchy that automatically adds separators via
    CSS.<br>
    <strong>example</strong><br>
    use an ordered or unordered list with linked list items to create a minimal-styled breadcrumb. use our utilities to add additional styles as desired.
  </p>
  <h3>dividers</h3>
  <p>dividers are automatically added in CSS through before and content. they can be changed by modifying a local 
    CSS custom property --bs-breadcrumb-divider.
    you can also remove the divider setting --bs-breadcrumb-divider:'':(empty strings in CSS custom properties 
    counts as a value).
  </p>
  <h2>block buttons</h2>
  <p> Additional utilities can be used to adjust the alignment of buttons when horizontal. here we've taken our previous 
    responsive example and added some flex utilities and a margin utility on the button to right-align the buttons 
    when they're no longer stacked.
  </p>
  <h2>button group</h2>
  <p> Group a series of buttons together on a single line or stack them in a vertical column.</p>
  <h4>basic example</h4>
  <p>wrap a series of buttons with <code>.btn</code> in <code>.btn-group</code>
  these classes can be added to groups of links, as an alternative to the .nav navigation components. </p>
<ul><li>mixed styles</li>
<li>outlined styles</li>
</ul>
<h3>button toolbars</h3>
<p> Combine sets of button groups into button toolbars for more complex components, and use utility classes as 
  needed to space out groups. buttons, and more.
  <hr> Feel free to mix input groups with button groups in your toolbars. similar to the example above.
  you'll likely need some utilities through to space things properly.
</p>
<h3>sizing</h3>
<p>instead of applying button sizing classes to every button in a group. just add .btn-group-* to each 
  .btn-gorup. including each one when nesting multiple groups.
</p>
<h3>nesting</h3>

<h1 class="text-center">carousels</h1>
<p>a slideshow component for cycling through elements -- images or slides of text-- like a carousel.</p>  
<h2>how it works</h2>
<p> The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content. built with CSS 3D transforms and 
  a bit of JavaScript. <br>
  it works with a series of images. text, or custom markup it also includes support for previous/next controls
  and indicators, <br>
  for performance reasons. carousels must be manually initialization, some of the event listeners 
  (specifically the events needed touch/swipe support) will not be registered until a user has explicitly
   activated a control or indicator. <br>
   The only exception is auto-playing carousels with the data-bs-ride="carousel" attribute as these are
    initialized automatically on page load. If you're using auto-playing carousels with the data attribute,
     don't explicitly initialize the same carousels with the constructor method.
Nested carousels are not supported. You should also be aware that carousels in general can often cause
 usability and accessibility challenges.
</p>
<h3>example</h3>
<p> Here is a basic example of a carousel with three slides <br>
  <strong>note</strong> the previous/next controls we recommend using &lt;button&gt; elements. but you 
  can also use &lt;a&gt; elements with role="button".
</p>
<P> Carousels don't automatically normalize slice dimensions. As such, you may need to use additional utilities
  or custom styles to appropriately size content. <br>
  while carousels support previous/next controls and indicators they're not explicitly
  required. add and customize as you see fit. <br>
  you must add <code>active-class</code> to one of the slides, otherwise the carousel will not be visible. <br>
also, be sure to set a unique ID on the <code>.carousel</code> for optional controls. especially if you're
 using multiple carousels on a single page. control and indicator elements must have a data-bs-target attribute
  (or href for links) that matches the id of the carousel element.
</P>
<h4>indicators</h4>
<p> You can add indicators to the carousel. alongside the previous/next controls. the indicators let users jump
  directly to a particular slide.
</p>
<h4>captions</h4>
<p> You can add captions to your slides with the <code>.carousel-caption</code> element within any 
  <code>.carousel-item</code> they can be easily hidden on smaller viewports. as shown below. with optional
   display utilities. we hide them initially with d-none and bring them back on medium-sized devices
    with d-md-block</p>
    <h4>crossfade</h4>
    <p> Add <strong>.carousel-fade</strong> to your carousel to animate slides with a fade transition instead of 
    a slide. depending on your carousel content (e.g. text-only slides). you may want to add .bg-body or
     some custom CSS to the .carousel-items for proper crossfading. </p>
    <h4>autoplaying carousels</h4>
    <p> You can make your carousels autoplay on page load by setting the ride option to the carousel. <br>
    autoplay carousels automatically pause while hovering with the mouse. this behavior can be controlled
     with the pause option.
    browsers that support the page visibility API. The carousel will stop cycling when the webpage is not
     visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive. or when the browser window is minimized). <br>
    when the ride option is set to true, rather than carousel, the carousel won't automatically start to 
      cycle on page load, instead, it will only start after the first user interaction.
     </p>
     <h4>individaul .carousel-item interval</h4>
     <p>add <code>.data-bs-interval=" </code> to a <code>.carousel-item</code> to change the amount of time to 
    delay between automatically cycling to the next item.</p>
<h4>autoplaying carousels without controls</h4>
<p>here's a carousel with slides only, <strong>note!</strong> the presence of the .d-block and w-100 on 
carousel images to prevent browser default image alignment.</p>
<h4>disable touch swiping</h4>
<p> Carousel supports swiping left/right on touchscreen devices to move between slides. this can be disabled 
  by setting the touch option to false.
</p>
<h4>dark variant</h4>
<p> Add carousel-dark to the carousel for darker controls. indicators, and captions. controls are inverted 
  compared to their default white fill with the filer CSS property. captions and controls have additional
   Sass variables that customize the color and background color.
</p>
<h2>close button</h2>
<p>a generic close button for dismissing content like modals and alerts.</p>
<h4>example</h4>
<p> Provide an option to dismiss or close a component with <code>.btn-close</code> default styling is limited 
but highly customizable. be sure to include text for screen readers, as we've done with aria labels.</p>
<h4>disalbe state</h4>
<p> Disabled close buttons change their opacity. we've also applied pointer-events none and user-select none 
  to preventing houve and active states from triggering.
</p>
<h2>collapse</h2>
<p>toggle the visibility of content across your project with a few classes and our JavaScript plugins.</p>
<h4>how it works</h4>
<p> The collapse JavaScript plugins are used to show and hide content. buttons or anchors are used as triggers
   that are mapped to specific elements you toggle. collapsing an element will animate the height from its 
   current value to 0. given how CSS handles it. animations, you can't use padding on a collapse element instead
    use the class as an independent wrapping element. <br>
  click the buttons below to show and hide another element via class changes. </p>
  <ul><li>collapse hides content</li>
  <li> Collapsing is applied during transitions.</li>
<li>collapse show shows content</li></ul>
<p>generally, we recommend using a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> with the data-bs-target attribute. while not
   recommended from a semantic point of view. you can also use an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> link with the href 
   attribute (and a role="button") in both cases the <code>data-bs-toggle"collapse"</code> is required.</p>
<h4>horizontal</h4>
<p> The collapse plugin supports horizontal collapsing. add the collapse-horizontal modifier class to transition 
  the width instead of height and set a width on the immediate child element.
</p>
<h2>dropdowns</h2>
<p>toggle contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more with the bootstrap dropdown plugin. <br>
<strong> dropdowns</strong> are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more. they're 
made interactive with the included bootstrap dropdown JavaScript plugin. they're toggled by clicking. not by hovering;
this is an international design decision. <br>
<strong>dropdowns</strong> are built on a third-party library. popper. which provides dynamic positioning and viewport 
detection. be sure to include <code>popper.min.js</code> before bootstrap's JavaScript or use <code>bootstrap.bundle.min.js /
  bootstrap.bundle.js</code> which contains popper isn't used to position dropdowns in navbars as dynamic 
  positioning isn't required
</p>
<h3>exmaple</h3>
<p> Wrap the dropdown's toggle (your button or link) and the dropdown menu within the dropdown. or another element that declares 
  <code>position:relative;</code> </p>
  </div>
</div></body>
</html>
